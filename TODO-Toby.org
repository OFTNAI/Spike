*** Questions / thoughts
**** What is a "backend"?
+ A set of classes / functions that performs the computations represented in the front end.
+ Specialises the computations for efficiency
  - but the front end is agnostic about these specialisations
  - consequently, there is a common API
+ Each backend can therefore be thought of as a 'sublibrary'
+ Front end only exposes the structure of the computations, not their implementation
  - but what divides 'structure' from 'implementation'?
    * this is the old 'structure'/'content' problem!...
+ Back end represents the state of the computation, as required by the associated device
**** What is the dispatch mechanism?
+ Each Model is associated with a context, and the context determines the backend
+ The context is associated with a device manager
** DONE Make frontend classes backend-agnostic

+ If prepare_backend hasn't been called before backend is needed, then we should not just crash.
