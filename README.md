# Spike
http://oftnai.github.io/Spike/

A GPGPU based Spiking Neural Network (SNN) designed to be as transparent and easy to modify as possible. Written in C++/CUDA.

This simulator is currently operational but under development and testing. An effort is being made to ensure the code meets standards and practices and that the testing is sufficiently borad. The script is regularly tested on Mac OSX (Yosemite) with a Geforce GTX 980 and CUDA toolkit v7.5.
