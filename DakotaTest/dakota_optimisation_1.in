# Case 1 (Massively Serial): Run Dakota in parallel and launch M-1 serial
#         analysis jobs at once.  Do not specify any evaluation concurrency
#         (handled by parallel scheduler)
#         fork interface is recommended

# In an M processor allocation, by default Dakota will configure with
# a master scheduler with M-1 slave analysis processes.  Overriding
# this with evaluation_scheduling peer static will avoid this dedicated 
# master and use all M processors, but then each batch of M analyses will 
# have to complete before the next M are scheduled.  This may be useful if 
# all evaluations are known to take the same processor time:

#	  evaluation_scheduling peer static

# Dynamic scheduling may also be specified. In this mode, the first peer will
# attempt to act as both a master scheduler and an evaluation server. 
# Consequently, all M processors will be used as in the static case. Unlike the
# static case, evaluations are delegated to servers on the fly, making dynamic
# scheduling the better choice when evaluations may be of varying duration.

#         evaluation_scheduling peer dynamic
