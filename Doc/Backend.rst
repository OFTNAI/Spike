Backend Structure
=================

This document describes the structure of a Spike backend. For a simple
reference implementation, see the `Dummy` backend (in `Spike/Backends/Dummy`),
which provides stub implementations of all the frontend classes, and which is
used as a fallback in case a requested backend is not available at runtime.
