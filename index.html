<p>This simulator was designed on Mac OSX for use with high-end NVIDIA GPUs. I have currently been able to achieve speeds rivaling some of the fastest simulators available. The simulator can currently compute 1000 timesteps of a 6000 neuron simulation in just over 1s (~1.25s) on a Geforce GTX 980 GPU and continues to increase in speed.</p>

<p>There is no lack of Spiking Neural Network simulators which are freely available and published. However, many of these succumb to issues due to their intention of providing a single platform for all researchers working in Computational Neuroscience. They are often written in a high level language to aid understanding, are filled with many potential features and hide the complexity as much as possible. </p>

<p>The result is code which runs slowly, has many more options than an individual needs and simultaneously can be difficult to alter or add new features to without significant investment of time in understanding the code. I personally encountered this issue when beginning my PhD. After testing more than half a dozen simulators I decided to try to write yet another such simulator. It would be written in heavily commented C++, with as few number of lines as possible. This would make the method by which it operates more transparent and open to understanding. I have created (and will continue to create) a set of unit tests for every function and operation of my code. This has been in order to eliminate the possibility of errors creeping into my code.</p>

<p>The code is currently designed (and is operational) for networks of Izhikevich Neurons, Poisson Neurons and Spike Generators (Neurons for which you set the specific times at which they should spike).</p>
